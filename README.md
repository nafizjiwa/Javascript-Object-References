# Object-References<br>
------
Object Literal:

    let objectName = {
    'Property Name': 'Property Value',
    propName: 'Prop Value'
    };
    
Methods are data stored in an object as a function<br>
Properties are what an object has and a method is what an object does.<br>
Methods in our object literals by creating ordinary, colon-separated key-value pairs. The key serves as our methodâ€™s name, while the value is an anonymous function expression.<br>
